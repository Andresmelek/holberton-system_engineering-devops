#0x13. Firewall
---
- In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the Internet.
- Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or host-based firewalls.
- Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks and run on network hardware. 
- Host-based firewalls run on host computers and control network traffic in and out of those machines.
